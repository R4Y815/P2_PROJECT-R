Things to do(in sequence)
0) Data Validation!

1) Lap timing doesn't disply properly if user keys in 10.00.010.. (becomes. 10.undefined.010)

2) insert photos for RC Track layouts
  - probably make it such that the photo of the RC track can float over when the user clicks in and looks at the RC Track.  

3) Rework display layout for Tracktimes-scuh that using selects setup and the chassis name, type of chassis is automaticaloly displayed- it makes more sense- rather than having the user reselect that again. 

4) CSS layout! it needs to be really optimissed for mobile usage. 
   Right now, the NewSetups page is still too wide for mobile because of the display of the parameters. 

5) Future: Allow users to upload Photos of their chassis layout to be 
  able to see and refer to their electronics layout.
